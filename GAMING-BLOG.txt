<p class="firstparagraph">In this blog which is focused about gaming (Pros/Cons, etc.) I will review my currrently played games and also I expect some positive feedback from you if you
  already followed my written article. I did not want to upset or make the wrong impresion for somebody, because this article
will be based within my personal experience (<b>while using some sources from Internet</b>). This project is mainly for my studies
and for my long term future goals. Thank you for understanding me.</p>

<p> I started playing video games since my teenagehood, and my first gaming "machine" was PC (if I remember well the first game it was Super Mario). As the time progressed the gaming industry become more and more
  popular same as technologies. We did not imagined those "modern" technologies 20 years ago. Back in 2001 I remember that I played the game MAX PAYNE. In that time that game graphics and overall looked really realistic,
  but it looks bit weird nowadays if you will try to compare modern shooting games such as Gears of war 4(xbox one) or Uncharted 4 (PS4), Battlefield 1 (multiplatform) etc. </p>

<p> I am currently playing most of the games with my PS4 pro console (I got used to it) but I might be considering of buying xbox one x in future, as it have more horses (power) I believe both consoles are great
    also I do like PC gaming , as the graphics looks even more realistic if you own more "posh" hardware </p>
